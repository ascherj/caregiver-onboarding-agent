Goal
Build a small app where a chat agent onboards a caregiver. It should conversationally collect and persist the fields in the schema below, from chat-style text or voice notes, and reply in 1–2 messages per turn. It must know when to stop once it has “enough” information.


AI tools are allowed and encouraged, disclose exactly what you used.


Do what you can in 48 hours, do not spend more time than that.

What to Build (MVP)
Chat UI (web is fine) that simulates SMS:

User can send text or upload a voice note (≤60s).

Agent replies in 1–2 concise messages.

Voice support:

Convert voice note → text (STT).

Agent responds normally based on the transcript.

Agent logic:

Extract relevant facts.

Ask for missing or ambiguous items.

Stop when the record is reasonably complete; say a friendly wrap-up line.

Persistence:

Save collected fields to a data store that matches the schema — this can be an in-memory DB for purposes of the exercise.

Show a live “profile preview” pane so we can see what’s been captured.

Disclosure:

Include a short AI usage note in README (models, prompts, libraries, how/where used).


Caregiver Schema
location: text("location"),
profilePictureUrl: text("profilePictureUrl"),
status: text("status").notNull().default("in_progress"),
qualifications: text("qualifications").array(),
languages: text("languages").array(),
startDate: text("startDate"),
generalAvailability: text("generalAvailability"),
preferredAgeGroups: text("preferredAgeGroups").array(),
weeklyHours: text("weeklyHours"),
commuteDistance: text("commuteDistance"),
commuteType: text("commuteType"),
willDriveChildren: text("willDriveChildren"),
accessibilityNeeds: text("accessibilityNeeds"),
dietaryPreferences: text("dietaryPreferences").array(),
yearsOfExperience: json("yearsOfExperience"), // breakdown by type
responsibilities: text("responsibilities").array(),
hourlyRate: text("hourlyRate"),
additionalChildRate: text("additionalChildRate"),
payrollRequired: text("payrollRequired"),
benefitsRequired: text("benefitsRequired").array(),
careTypes: text("careTypes").array(),

Notes

Treat all fields as optional during collection except those critical for a viable profile: location, languages, careTypes,  hourlyRate


Voice & Tone (make it feel human)
Warm, clear, and efficient. No corporate bot tone.

Acknowledge what the caregiver just said; avoid repeating questions verbatim.

Use 1–2 messages max per turn. Prefer one.

Confirm inferred details gently: “Sounds like weekdays 9–5, did I get that right?”

Knows when to stop: if all critical fields + majority of optional fields are captured or user signals fatigue, wrap up with a summary + next steps.


Conversation Behavior Requirements
Memory & extraction: Parse free-form text/voice into fields; fill arrays and JSONs reasonably.

Context carryover: Don’t re-ask answered items; ask the next best question.

Ambiguity handling: If a statement is unclear (“I’m free afternoons”), store it and ask a light clarifier (“Which days?”).

Stop condition:

Collected ≥80% of fields or user says “that’s enough”.

Send short recap of captured info.

Ask for one missing high-value item if any (e.g., rate).

Provide a link/button to upload resume/profile photo (optional).

Safety: No sensitive data beyond what’s in schema; never ask for SSN, DOB, or home address.


Suggested Stack (not required)
Frontend: Next.js/React (or anything fast). Simple chat pane + profile preview.

Agent: Your choice (OpenAI function calling, toolformer, RAG, custom rules). Show how you extract + map to schema.

Store: SQLite/Postgres/Prisma/Drizzle—anything we can run locally.

Auth: Not required, but give your suggestion on what you'd use if this were productionized.


What to Submit
Repo with:

README.md including:

How to run locally (2–3 commands).

AI usage disclosure (models, prompts, where/why).

Design notes: your state machine/flow, stop condition, and extraction approach.

Minimal seed script or demo script.

Live demo (we'll schedule time):

One text flow, one voice flow.

Stop behavior and saved record view.
